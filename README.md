## About fflow

React is the most popular library used by frontend developers today. Yet, getting a React application started requires a too much boilerplate code and unnecessary time.

fflow is a free, open-source developer tool to create React applications rapidly and with minimal effort using the simple drag and drop UI. It combines the most compelling features of Create React App, React ES6 snippets, and a beautiful user experience. Here is a medium article describing the philosophy behind fflow and you can download it here.

We are really excited to launch this alpha version and hope you will download, play around with it, and provide us with feedback.

Visit our website here üëâ https://fflow.dev

## Getting Started

The following instructions are split into two sections for:

- [Production Mode](#production-mode)
- [Development Mode](#development-mode)

## Production Mode

Please download the latest release of fflow for [MacOS](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/fflow/releases) or [Windows](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/fflow/releases).

<!-- [Linux](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/fflow/releases) -->

üí´ Linux version coming soon. üí´

- **Mac users**: After opening the dmg and dragging fflow into your Applications folder, `CTL + Click` the icon and 'Open' from the context menu to open the app. This extra step is necessary since we don't have an Apple developer license yet.

- **Windows users**: Install the application by running fflow setup 1.0.0.exe.

<!-- - **Linux users**: Run the application as a super user in order to read and write files. -->

<!-- #### Drag, Drop, Reorder and Delete HTML Tags onto Canvas

#### Nest HTML Tags and Components within custom React Components

#### Style your project

Add styles to your HTML elements and React Components by editing directly in the CSS Editor. This will then be exported with your app.

#### Clearing the Canvas

## Development Mode -->

#### Clone this repo

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/fflow`
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`
3. Copy and run this in your terminal (`./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild`) or `.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd` for Windows
4. Run script for development mode `npm run start`
5. Build the app (automatic) `npm run build`
6. Test the app (after `npm run build` || `yarn run build`) `npm run prod`

#### Current issues

Note there is currently an issue where the Monaco Code Editor keeps showing 'loading...' in development mode. We are working to solve this. In the meantime, when you drag HTML tags onto canvas you can still see the code editor's contents in the Developer Tools.

#### Running tests

Electron, React and Redux tests can be run using `npm run test`

## Run Exported Project

Below is the generated directory structure of the React and Webpack application that is created when you export your application.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist                    # Compiled files
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src                     # Source files
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webpack.config.js       # Webpack configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .babelrc                # Babel configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore              # Git ignore file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Dependencies file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Boilerplate README file

```

1. Using the inbuilt terminal, `cd` into the Exported Project in your `Downloads` folder
2. In the root of the Exported Project folder, install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start an instance `npm run start`
4. If `Localhost:8080` does not open automatically in your default browser, navigate to the specified port to see your running app with Hot Module Reloading and a pre-configured webpack

<br />

### Add Sass

Adding Sass to your exported project requires updating webpack configs and adding necessary loaders.

1. Install loaders for sass, `sass-loader` and `node-sass`
2. Add another object to the rules in `webpack.config` with the following:

```javascript
 {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader',
          'sass-loader'
        ]
      }
```

3. Rename `styles.css` to `styles.scss`

### Add Tailwind

Adding Tailwind to your exported project requires updating webpack configs, adding necessary loaders and tailwind config.

1. Install tailwind as a dependency

```
npm install tailwindcss
```

2. Install postcss-loader and autoprefixer as development dependencies

```
npm install -D postcss-loader autoprefixer
```

3. Copy the following copy into `src/styles.css`

```css
@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```

4. Create a `postcss.config.js` file and copy the following code in

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require('tailwindcss'), require('autoprefixer')],
};
```

5. Add `'postcss-loader'` to the css rules in `webpack.config`

### Change App Title

This boilerplate names your project `Exported Project`. You can change the app title by inserting the app title within the `<title> </title>` tags in `index.html`.
